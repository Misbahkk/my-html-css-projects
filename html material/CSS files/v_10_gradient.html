        <h1>Computers</h1>
        <p>made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to the underlying
            hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952[12] by Grace Hopper, who
            also coined the term 'compiler'.[13][14] FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a
            functional implementation, came out in 1957,[15] and many other languages were soon developedâ€”in particular,
            COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.
